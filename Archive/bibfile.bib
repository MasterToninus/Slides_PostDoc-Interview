abstract = {A general construction of an sh Lie algebra (L ∞-algebra) from a homological resolution of a Lie algebra is given. It is applied to the space of local functionals equipped with a Poisson bracket, induced by a bracket for local functions along the lines suggested by Gel'fand, Dickey and Dorfman. In this way, higher order maps are constructed which combine to form an sh Lie algebra on the graded differential algebra of horizontal forms. The same construction applies for graded brackets in field theory such as the Batalin-Fradkin-Vilkovisky bracket of the Hamiltonian BRST theory or the Batalin-Vilkovisky antibracket.},

abstract = {In this note we construct a homotopy co-momentum map ([8, 56, 57]) trangressing to the standard hydrodynamical co-momentum map of Arnol'd, Marsden and Weinstein and others, then generalized to a special class of Riemannian manifolds. As a byproduct, a covariant phase space interpretation of Brylinski's manifold of mildly singular links is exhibited upon resorting to the Euler equation for perfect fluids. A semiclassical interpretation of the HOMFLYPT polynomial is also given, building on the Liu-Ricca hydrodynamical approach to the latter and on the Besana- S. symplectic approach to framing. We finally reinterpret the (Massey) higher order linking numbers in terms of conserved quantities within the multisymplectic framework and determine knot theoretic analogues of first integrals in involution.},

@article{Rogers2010,
abstract = {A manifold is multisymplectic, or more specifically n-plectic, if it is equipped with a closed nondegenerate differential form of degree n+1. In our previous work with Baez and Hoffnung, we described how the `higher analogs' of the algebraic and geometric structures found in symplectic geometry should naturally arise in 2-plectic geometry. In particular, we showed that just as a symplectic manifold gives a Poisson algebra of functions, any 2-plectic manifold gives a Lie 2-algebra of 1-forms and functions. Lie n-algebras are examples of L-infinity algebras: graded vector spaces which are equipped with a collection of skew-symmetric multi-brackets that satisfy a generalized Jacobi identity. Here, we generalize our previous result. Given an n-plectic manifold, we explicitly construct a corresponding Lie n-algebra on a complex consisting of differential forms whose multi-brackets are specified by the n-plectic structure. We also show that any n-plectic manifold gives rise to another kind of algebraic structure known as a differential graded Leibniz algebra. We conclude by describing the similarities between these two structures within the context of an open problem in the theory of strongly homotopy algebras.},

@article{Callies2016,
abstract = {Associated to any manifold equipped with a closed form of degree {\textgreater}1 is an ‘L$\infty$-algebra of observables' which acts as a higher/homotopy analog of the Poisson algebra of functions on a symplectic manifold. In order to study Lie group actions on these manifolds, we introduce a theory of homotopy moment maps. Such a map is a L$\infty$-morphism from the Lie algebra of the group into the observables which lifts the infinitesimal action. We establish the relationship between homotopy moment maps and equivariant de Rham cohomology, and analyze the obstruction theory for the existence of such maps. This allows us to easily and explicitly construct a large number of examples. These include results concerning group actions on loop spaces and moduli spaces of flat connections. Relationships are also established with previous work by others in classical field theory, algebroid theory, and dg geometry. Furthermore, we use our theory to geometrically construct various L$\infty$-algebras as higher central extensions of Lie algebras, in analogy with Kostant's quantization theory. In particular, the so-called ‘string Lie 2-algebra' arises this way.},

@article{Ryvkin2016,
abstract = {Given a vector field on a manifold {\$}M{\$} , we define a globally conserved quantity to be a differential form whose Lie derivative is exact. Integrals of conserved quantities over suitable submanifolds are constant under time evolution, the Kelvin circulation theorem being a well-known special case. More generally, conserved quantities are well behaved under transgression to spaces of maps into {\$}M{\$} . We focus on the case of multisymplectic manifolds and Hamiltonian vector fields. Our main result is that in the presence of a Lie group of symmetries admitting a homotopy co-momentum map, one obtains a whole family of globally conserved quantities. This extends a classical result in symplectic geometry. We carry this out in a general setting, considering several variants of the notion of globally conserved quantity.},
